#REST Chess

This is a simple python module, and eventually simple web server,
that will administrate a REST based multiplayer chess game.

My goal is to have an easy to use json api that allows players
to build their own AI player scripts to play against each other
over the 'net.

See the [example json api](./example_api.json) for how to interact
with the server.
